### What is this?

This repo is aiding me in my learning about AWS. Specifically I am focusing, for the moment, on getting a certification. In the future I may put some toy scale projects in here as well.

These notes are meant for me and may not be useful without the context of watching the content I am.

Currently I am working on this udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-developer-associate/
