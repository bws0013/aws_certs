EC2 Exam tips

Pricing models
  - On demand
    - You pay a fixed rate by the hour/second with no commitment
  - Reserved
    - A capacity reservation with 1 to 3 year contacts, the longer term the better rate
  - Spot
    - You bid whatever price you want for an instance capacity
    - Good for flexible start/end times
    - If AWS terminates your instance you wont be charged for that hour
  - Dedicated hosts
    - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use
    - Typically for licenses or regulatory requirements

All different instance type mnemonic
  - FIGHT DR MC PX

EBS Volumes
  - SSD
    - General Purpose SSD
      - Balances price/performance for a variety of workloads
      - Under 10000 iops
    - Provisioned IOPS SSD
      - Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
      - Over 10000 iops
  - Magnetic
    - Throughput optimized HDD
      - Low cost HDD volume for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
    - Cold HDD
      - Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
    - Magnetic
      - Previous generation and can be boot volume

3 Types of load balances
  - Application LB
  - Network LB
  - Classic (Elastic) LB

LB characteristics
  - 504 error means the gateway has timed out meaning the application is not responding within the idle timeout period
    - It is likely the web server or the DB server
  - If you need the IPv4 address of your end user, look for the X-Forwarded-For header

Route53
  - Amazon's DNS service
  - Allows you to map your domain names to
    - EC2 instances
    - LBs
    - S3 buckets

CLI Tips
  - Least privilege
    - Always give users the minimum access required
  - Create groups with group permissions
  - Secret access key you will only see once
  - Do not use just one access key, one per dev
  - You can use the CLI on your PC

Roles
  - Roles allow you to not use Access key ID's and Secret access keys
  - Roles are preferred from a security perspective
  - Roles are controlled by policies
  - You can change a policy on a role and it will take immediate affect
  - You can attach/detach roles to running ec2 instances without stopping these instances

Encryption of root device volumes
  - You can encrypt the root device volume (the volume the OS is installed on) using Operating system level encryption
  - You first take a snapshot of the volume then create a copy with encryption
  - You can encrypt additional attached volumes using the console, CLI or API

Databases
  - RDS
    - SQL
    - MySql
    - PostgreSQL
    - Oracle
    - Aurora
    - MariaDB
  - DynamoDB
    - NoSQL
  - Redshift
  - Elasticache
    - Memcached
    - Redis

Multi-AZ and read replicas
  - For disaster recovery only
  - For performance use read replicas
    - Used for scaling
    - Must have automatic backups turned on
    - You can have up to 5 read replica copies of any DB
    - You can have read replicas of read replicas (watch out for latency)
    - Each read replica will have its own DNS endpoint
    - You can have read replicas that have multi-AZ
    - You can create read replicas of Multi-AZ source databases
    - Read replicas can be promoted to be their own DBs which breaks replication
    - You can have a read replica in a different region for mySQL and mariaDB

DB related
  Elasticache
    - Good for read heavy DBs not prone to frequent changes
  Redshift
    - Good for large numbers of transactions

Use memcached if
  - Object caching is your primary goal
  - You want to keep things simple
  - You want to scale your cache horizontally
Use Redis if
  - You have advanced data types such as lists, hashes or sets
  - You are doing data sorting or ranking
  - Data persistence
  - Multi AZ
  - Pub/Sub capabilities are needed
