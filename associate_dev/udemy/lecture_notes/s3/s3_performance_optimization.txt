S3 Performance Optimization

S3 is designed to support very high request rates

If your buckets are receiving lots of requests here are some best practices
  - Get intensive workloads
    - Use CloudFront for best performance
    - Caches my frequently accessed objects
  - Mixed request type workloads
    - Object key names can impact performance for intensive workloads
    - S3 uses the name to determine which partition the object should be stored in
    - Sequential names (such as starting with timestamps) are more likely in the same partition
    - For heavy workloads this can cause I/O issues and contention
    - By using a random prefix to key-names you can force s3 to distribute keys across multiple partitions
      - This distributes the I/O workload
    - For optimal performance use random key prefixes

Exam Tips
  - 2 main approaches for optimization
    - Get intensive
      - Use cloudfront
    - Mixed intensive
      - Insert random prefixes for more evenly distributed hashing
    * Just kidding, logical and sequential naming conventions now are available without performance impact
      * Still know in case exam is old
