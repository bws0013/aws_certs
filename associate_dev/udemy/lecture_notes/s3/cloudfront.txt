CloudFront

Amazon's content delivery network

CDN
  - Content delivery network
  - A network of distributed servers that delivery web pages and other web content
    - Based on the geographic location of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server
  - Speeds up delivery of web content

Difference between cloudfront and transfer acceleration
  - cloudfront is focused on delivery
  - TA is focused on upload speed increases

Edge location
  - Data centers which are geographically dispersed
  - If a user is requesting your content they will do so from the edge location
    - If your user is in australia but the content is in the US it saves them the latency
    - The edge location forwards the request to the main server
    - The edge location then downloads the files and caches them locally
  - Cached objects are cached for a time (time to live)
    - After which time they are cleared
    - You can clear the cache for a fee, say if you had a new version of your object

CloudFront Distribution Types
  - Web Distribution
    - Used for websites, HTTP/HTTPS
  - RTMP Distribution
    - Media streaming / Flash multi-media content

S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - Enables fast transfers over long distances
  - Takes advantage of CloudFront distributed edges

Exam Tips:
Edge location
  - This is the location where content is cached and can be written
    - Separate to an AWS Region/AZ
  - Because you can clear the cache and replace objects you have WRITE (effectively)
Origin
  - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distributed
  - Origins can be an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, or Elastic load balancer or Route53
Distribution
  - This is the name, given the CDN, which consists of a collection of Edge locations
  - 2 types
  - Web Distribution
    - Typically used for websites
  - RTMP
    - Used for media streaming
S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - Enables fast transfers over long distances
  - Takes advantage of CloudFront distributed edges
Requests for content are automatically routed to the closest edge node
