S3 Encryption

In transit
  - SSL/TLS
    - Transport Layer Security (TLS) is replacing SSL

At Rest
  - Server Side Encryption
    - S3 managed keys - SSE-S3
    - Aws Key management service, managed keys, SSE-KMS

Client Side encryption
  - You encrypt files before uploading

Enforcing Encryption on S3 buckets
  - Every time a file is uploaded, a PUT request is made
  - If the files is to be encrypted at upload time a request header is included
    - parameter x-amz-server-side-encryption
    - When the parameter is included in the PUT request it tells s3 to encrypt on upload with that encryption method
  - Two options are available for upload encryption
    - x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256 (S3 managed keys)
    - x-amz-server-side-encryption: KMS (KMS managed keys)
  - You can enforce the use of encryption on the server side with a bucket policy
    - Deny any s3 put requests that dont include the x-amz-server-side-encryption param in the request header

Exam tips
  - Encryption in transit
  - Encryption at rest
    - Server or client side
  - You can enforce the encryption for files in s3 use an s3 bucket policy
