S3 101

Simple Storage Service

Provides devs with secure highly-scalable object storage
  - Files
  - Images
  - Webpages
  - Not for ISOs or DBs

Object based storage only, no block storage

Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities

Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB in size

There is unlimited storage

Files are stored in buckets (similar to folder)
  - User defined

S3 has a universal namespace
  - Similar to dns address
  - No two buckets can have the same name even in different regions

You receive an http 200 code if the upload was successful (API/CLI)

Data consistency model
  - Read after Write consistency for Puts of new objects
    - As soon as you upload your file it is available to read
  - Eventual Consistency for overwrite Puts and Deletes
    - There is some propagation delay

S3 is object based, objects consist of the following
  - Key
    - Name of the object
  - Value
    - The data (A sequence of bytes)
  - Version ID (for versioning)
  - Metadata
    - You can add metadata such as team name or project name
  - Sub-resources (bucket specific policies)
    - Bucket policies, Access control lists
  - Cross Origin Resource Sharing
    - Instructions on how files in one bucket can access those in another
  - Transfer Acceleration
    - Allows you to accelerate file transfer speeds when uploading lots of files to s3

99.99% availability for the s3 platform
  - Amazon only guarantees 99.9% availability
  - 11 9s of durability
    - Durability being the amount of data not lost per year

Tiered Storage available
  - Cater to different requirements or types of data you may be storing
Lifecycle management
  - Manage your data's movement between different storage tiers
Versioning
Encryption
Secure your data - Access
  - Control Lists and Bucket Policies

S3 storage tiers
  - S3
    - Data stored redundantly, designed for 2 data center outages concurrently
  - S3 - IA (infrequently accessed)
    - For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
    - Lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retrieval fee
  - S3 - One Zone IA
    - Same as IA but data is stored only in a single availability zone
    - 99.5% availability
    - 20% cheaper than S3 - IA
  - Reduced Redundancy Storage
    - 99.99% durability and availability over a given year
    - Used for data that can be re-created if lost eg video/image thumbnails
    - This is not a recommended storage class by Amazon
  - Glacier
    - Not strictly part of s3 but interacts with it heavily
    - Very cheap but used for archival purposes only
    - Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed
    - Takes 3-5 hours to restore for glacier

S3 charges
  - Charged for
    - Storage per GB
    - Requests (Get, Put, Copy, etc)
    - Storage Management Pricing
      - Inventory, Analytics and object tags
    - Data management pricing
      - Data transferred out of S3
         - Downloading a file costs money but upload is free
    - Transfer Acceleration
      - Use of CloudFront to optimize transfers
