EC2 With S3 Roles

Roles allow for assigning permissions to a role (like a tag) and then giving that role to a particular user
  - The user inherits the permissions as provided by the role

Remove credentials if they remain on the system
  - Located in root user: ~/.aws
    - Delete credentials/ and config/

Exam tips
  - Roles allow you to not use Access Key IDs and Secret Access Keys
  - Roles are preferable from a security perspective
  - Roles are controlled by policies
  - You can change a policy on a role and it will immediately go into affect
  - You can attach/detach roles without restarting/stopping EC2 instances
  - Roles can be viewed as JSON representing permissions
