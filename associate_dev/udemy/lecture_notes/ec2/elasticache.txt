ElastiCache


Service allowing for easily making a scalable in-memory cache in the cloud

Features
  - Improves web app performance by not having to rely on slow disk based reads
  - Takes a lot of load of prod dbs
  - Use on those queries that are very frequently run
  - Improves latency by storing in-memory

Types of elasticache
  - Memchached
  - Redis

Memchached
  - A widely adopted memory object caching system
  - Elasticache is protocol compliant with Memchached so tools build for Memchached can be used with elasticache
  - Pure caching solution with no persistence
    - Individual nodes are expendable

Redis
  - Open-source in-memory key-value store used when needing to support data structures such as sorted sets and lists
  - Supports master/slave replication and multi-az to achieve cross az redundancy
  - Managed as stateful entities that include failover similar to how RDS manages DB failover

Both Memchached and Redis are in-memory key stores

Memchached - Use cases
  - If object caching is primary goal
  - Simplicity
  - Multithreaded performance and multi-core
  - Horizontal scalability

Redis - Use cases
  - Advanced data types such as hashes and sets
  - Need to sort/rank (leaderboard)
  - Persistence of key store important
  - Need multi-az with failover
