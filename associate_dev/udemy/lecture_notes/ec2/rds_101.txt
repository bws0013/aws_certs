RDS

Relational Database Service

Exam Tips
  - RDS is OLTP
  - DynamoDB is noSQL
  - Redshift is OLAP, business intelligence and big data processing
  - ElastiCache is in memory caching 

6 DB types through AWS that can be provisioned
  - SQL Server
  - Oracle
  - MySQL Server
  - PostgreSQL
  - Aurora
  - MariaDB

Aurora is Amazon's own flagship db technology
  - Allows for migrating from MySQL to Aurora

Non Relational Database Elements
  - Collection = Table
  - Document = Row
  - Key Value Pairs = Fields

Data Warehousing
  - Used for business intelligence
  - Think Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server
  - Used to pull in very large and complex data sets
  - Usually used to do queries on data such as current performance vs targets, etc
  - Prod database may push data to a data warehouse where it is later analyzed

OLTP vs OLAP
  - Online Transition Processing (OLTP)
  - Online Analytics Processing (OLAP)
  - The 2 differ in terms of the types of queries run on each
  - OLAP can be a lot more complex

ElastiCache
  - Web Service for easily deploying, operating and scaling an in memory cache in the cloud
  - Improves performance of web apps by allowing you to retrieve information from memory caches instead of disk based DBs
  - Supports 2 open-source in memory caching engines
    - Memchached
    - Redis
