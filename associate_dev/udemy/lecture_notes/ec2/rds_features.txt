RDS

back ups, multi-AZ and read replicas

You are never given an IP for a DB only a hostname (dns endpoint)

2 types of backups
  - Automated Backups
  - Snapshots

Automated Backups
  - Allow you to recover your DB to any point in time within a retention period (1-35 days)
  - Saves full daily snapshot and transaction logs
  - Will use the most recent backup and apply those transactions to do a restore
  - Allows point in time retention down to a second
  - Stored on s3 with you getting free space up to the size of the db
  - Taken during a defined window
  - Storage IO may be suspended during backup causing latency
  - Deleted when DB is deleted

Snapshots
  - Snapshot of the DB
  - Always done manually (user initiative)
  - Stored even after you delete DB

Restoring DB instances
  - Weather restoring from a Snapshot or Automated Backup your restored instance will be a new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint
  - Restore will be completely separate DB with completely separate DNS endpoint

Encryption
  - At rest encryption is supported on the following
    - Mysql, Oracle, SqlServer, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora
  - Encryption is done using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
  - Once encrypted, the following are encrypted
    - The data stored at rest, automated backups, read replicas, snapshots
  - At the moment, encrypting an existing DB instance is not supported
    - You must first create a snapshot, create a copy and encrypt the copy

Multi-AZ
  - Any changes made to the primary DB will be synchronously made to another DB
    - The other DB will be an exact copy of the primary DB
  - Used for disaster recovery only
  - In the event our primary DB becomes unavailable, we will automatically fail over to our other DB
  - The DNS endpoint remains the same but AWS automatically changes the DNS settings to point to our other DB
    - Failover is automatic
  - Allows you to have an exact copy of your prod DB in another AZ
  - Downtime will be in minutes or less
  - Should not be used for performance improvements
  - Available for:
    - SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
    - Aurora is spread over multiples AZs by default

Read-replicas
  - Used for performance improvements
  - If most of your db traffic is reading this is highly scalable
  - You can have read-replicas of read-replicas but you risk some replication latency
  - You can have read-replicas in other AZs or other regions
  - Read-only copy of your DB
  - Actions performed asynchronously
  - Available for:
    - MySQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora
  - Used for scaling, not disaster recovery
  - You must have automatic backups turned on to deploy a read replica
  - You can have up to 5 read replica copies of any DB
  - Each replica will have its own DNS endpoint
  - You can have replicas that have multi-AZ enabled
  - You can create read replicas of multi-AZ source DBs
  - Can be promoted to be their own DBS
    - This breaks the replication
