EC2 (Elastic Computing Cloud)

Web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud

EC2 exam tips
  On demand instance
  Reserved instance
  Spot
  Dedicated hosts
  Note on spot instances
    - If a spot instance is terminated by AWS EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of use
    - If you terminate the instance yourself you will be charged for the complete hour the instance ran
    - This is a popular exam questions
  general purpose ssd
  provisioned IOPS ssd
  throughput optimized HDD
  cold HDD
  magnetic

Two types of instances
  On demand instance
    - allowing payment by the hour or second with no commitment
    - good for testing or unpredictable work loads
  Reserved instance
    - provides a capacity reservation
    - significant discount on paying hourly
    - 1 or 3 year terms
    - good for steady state or predictable usage
  Spot
    - bid whatever you want for instance capacity
    - provides big saving if your apps have flexible start/end times
    - spot prices moves around all the time
    - good for flexible start/end times
    - good for apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
  Dedicated hosts
    - physical EC2 server dedicated to your use
    - can allow you to save money by allowing you to use existing server bound software licenses
    - good for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
    - can be purchased on-demand (hourly)

EBS
  Elastic Block Storage
  Allows you to create storage volumes and attach them EC2 instances
    - once attached you can run a file system/db/etc
  Placed in a specific AZ
    - auto replicated
  Volume types
    - general purpose ssd (GP2)
      - balances price and performance
      - use if you need at most 10000 IOPS (input/output per second)
      - can be boot volume
    - provisioned IOPS ssd (IO1)
      - designed for IO intensive applications such as large (no)sql databases
      - use if you need more than 10000 IOPS
      - can be boot volume
    - throughput optimized HDD (ST1)
      - big data
      - data warehousing
      - log processing
      - this cannot be a boot volume, they need to be additional volumes
    - cold HDD (SC1)
      - lowest cost
      - meant for infrequently accessed workloads
      - cannot be a boot volume
      - eg file server
    - magnetic (standard)
      - can be boot volume
      - lowest cost per gb of all ebs volumes that is bootable
      - ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently
      - ideal for applications where lowest storage cost is important
      - this is legacy
