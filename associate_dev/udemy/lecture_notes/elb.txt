ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)

Allows you to balance traffic (a load) across servers
  No one server will get overwhelmed

ELB exam tips
  3 types of LBs in AWS
    - Application Load Balancer
    - Network Load Balancer
    - Classic Load Balancer
  504 Error means the gateway has timed out.
    - This means the application is not responding within the timeout period
    - Troubleshooting should start with the app
  X-forwarded-for header
    - Look here for the public ip of your end user 

3 types of LBs in AWS
  Application Load Balancer
    - Layer 7
    - Best suited for HTTP/S
    - Send specified requests to specific web servers
    - Can make decisions based on url (eg aws.amazon.com packets would go to AWS)
  Network Load Balancer
    - Best suited for Layer 4 (TCP traffic)
    - Super fast performance/speed (millions of transactions/second)
    - Use in production if latency is an issue
    - Most expensive
  Classic Load Balancer
    - Not recommended anymore
    - Here for legacy purposes
    - The exam, however, is mostly on these (at time of video)
    - You can use layer 7 or 4 load balancing
    - If your app stops working you would get a 504 error
      - It means the LB is fine but something below the LB is
    - X-forwarded-for header
      - Header that contains public ip
