ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)

Allows you to balance traffic (a load) across servers
  No one server will get overwhelmed

3 types of LBs in AWS
  Application Load Balancer
    - Layer 7
    - Best suited for HTTP/S
    - Send specified requests to specific web servers
    - Can make decisions based on url (eg aws.amazon.com packets would go to AWS)
  Network Load Balancer
    - Best suited for Layer 4 (TCP traffic)
    - Super fast performance/speed (millions of transactions/second)
    - Use in production if latency is an issue
    - Most expensive
  Classic Load Balancer
    - Not recommended anymore
    - Here for legacy purposes
    - The exam is mostly on these (at time of video)
