Exam tips
  Least Privilege

    - Assign your users to groups
    - Your users will automatically inherit the permissions of the Groups
    - The groups permissions are assigned using the policy documents
  Secret Access Keys
    - You will only see this once
    - If you do not save you can delete and regenerate the key pair
    - You will need to run AWS configure again
  Do not use just one access key
