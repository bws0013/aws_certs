Serverless summary

Exam tips:
  - Lambda scales out (not up)
  - Lambda functions are independent, 1 event is 1 function
  - Its a compute service (know what services are serverless)
  - It is serverless
  - LFs can trigger other LFs so 1 event can be X functions if triggering a chain
  - Architecture can get complicated, use AWS X-ray to debug whats happening
  - Lambda can do things globally so you can use it to back up s3 buckets to other s3 buckets
  - Know your triggers (remember as many as you can)

Exam tips:
  - Remember what API gateway is at a high level
  - API gateway has caching capabilities
  - API gateway is low cost and scales automatically
  - You can throttle api gateway to prevent attacks
  - You can log results to cloudwatch
  - If you are using multiple domains (javascript/ajax) ensure you have cors enabled on API gateway
  - CORS is enforced by the client

Exam Tips
  - Can have multiple versions of lambda functions
  - Latest version will use $latest
  - Qualified versions will use $latest, Unqualified will not have it
  - Versions are immutable (cannot be changed)
  - Can split traffic using aliases to different versions
    - Cannot split traffic with $latest, instead create an alias to latest

Exam tips
  - Know what step functions are
    - A great way to visualize your serverless app
    - Automatically trigger and track each other
    - Step functions log the state of each step to help with debugging

Exam Tips
  - Understand what xray is
  - Understand what the sdk provides
    - Interceptors to add to your code to trace incoming HTTP requests
    - Client handlers to instrument AWS SDK clients that your app uses to call other services
    - An http client to use to instrument calls to other internal and external http web services
  - Understand what it integrates with
  - Know the languages

Exam Tips
  - API Throttling Limits
    - 5000 concurrent calls per second across api gateway
    - 10000 total calls per second across api gateway
  - You can use api gateway as a soap api passthrough
  - It supports Swagger v2.0 definition files
