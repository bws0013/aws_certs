Version Control With Lambda

With versioning in AWS Lambda you can publish multiple version of your Lambda function
  - Each lambda function has a unique ARN
    - After publishing this ARN cannot be changed

Qualified/Unqualified ARNs
  - Qualified
    - The function ARN with the version suffix
    - arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld:$LATEST
  - Unqualified ARN
    - The function ARN without the version suffix
    - arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld

ARN alias
  - We can create aliases to point to prod/staging/version 1/version 2/etc
  - You can change the value of the alias as if it were a variable
  - This type of aliasing can be used to set up blue/green deploys which aws allows right in the console

Exam Tips
  - Can have multiple versions of lambda functions
  - Latest version will use $latest
  - Qualified versions will use $latest, Unqualified will not have it
  - Versions are immutable (cannot be changed)
  - Can split traffic using aliases to different versions
    - Cannot split traffic with $latest, instead create an alias to latest
