Api Gateway

An API is an application programming interface

REST API
  - Representational State Transfer
  - Typically uses json

SOAP API
  - Simple Object Access Protocol
  - Uses XML

API Gateway is a fully managed service
  - Allows users to publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at scale
  - Acts as a front door for things such as AWS Lambda, EC2 or any web app

API Gateway Functionality
  - Exposes HTTPS endpoints to define a RESTful api
  - We can configure how the API responds to those calls
  - Severless-ly connect to services like lambda and DynamoDB
  - Send each API endpoint to a different target
  - Runs efficiently with low cost
  - Trace and control usage by API key
  - Throttle requests to prevent attacks
  - Connect to cloudwatch to log all requests for monitoring
  - Maintain multiple versions of your api

How to configure API Gateway
  - Define an api (container)
  - Define resources and nested resources (url paths)
  - For each resources
     - Select supported HTTP methods (verbs)
     - Set security
     - Choose target (such as EC2, lambda, DynamoDB)
     - Set requests and response transformations
  - Deploy API to a stage
    - Uses API gateway domain, by default
    - You can use a custom domain
    - Supports AWS cert manager: free ssl/tls certs

API caching
  - Cache your endpoints response
  - Reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve latency
  - Lives for a specified TTL period
  - API gateway responds to a request by looking up the endpoint response from cache instead of making a request to your endpoint
  - You can enable this or not

Same-Origin Policy
  - Browsers permit scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second page if both have the same origin
    - This prevents XSS
  - Enforced by web browsers
  - Ignored by PostMan and curl

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
  - A way (on the server end, not client) to relax the same-origin policy
  - Mechanism that allows restricted resources (eg fonts) on a webpage to be requested from another domain
  - This domain can be outside the domain from which the first resource was served

Exam tips
  - Remember what API gateway is at a high level
  - API gateway has caching capabilities
  - API gateway is low cost and scales automatically
  - You can throttle api gateway to prevent attacks
  - You can log results to cloudwatch
  - If you are using multiple domains (javascript/ajax) ensure you have cors enabled on API gateway
  - CORS is enforced by the client
