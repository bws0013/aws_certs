Lambda 101

What is lambda
  - Lambda is a compute service where you can upload code and make a lambda function
  - AWS takes care of the provisioning and managing of the servers that are used to run you coode
  - You dont worry about patching, scaling, os, etc
  - It can act as an event driven compute service where aws lambda runs your code in response to events
    - eg these events being triggered by changes to data in an S3 bucket or DynamoDB instance
  - It can be used as a compute service to run your code in response to http requests
    - For this you use API gateway or api calls from the AWS SDKs

Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions

Languages supported
  - node.js
  - java
  - python
  - C#
  - go

Lambda is priced by number of requests
  - First 1 million requests are free
  - After that it is $0.20 per million requests
  - It is also priced based on duration
    - Time your code starts to the time it ends rounded to nearest 100ms

Exam tips:
  Lambda scales out (not up)
  Lambda functions are independent, 1 event is 1 function
  Its a compute service (know what services are serverless)
  It is serverless
  LFs can trigger other LFs so 1 event can be X functions if triggering a chain
  Architecture can get complicated, use AWS X-ray to debug whats happening
  Lambda can do things globally so you can use it to back up s3 buckets to other s3 buckets
  Know your triggers (remember as many as you can)
